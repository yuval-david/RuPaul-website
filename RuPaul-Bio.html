                RuPaul's Drag Race is an American reality competition television series produced by World of Wonder for
                Logo
                TV, WOW Presents Plus, and, beginning with the ninth season VH1. The show documents RuPaul in the search
                for
                "America's next drag superstar." RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series,
                as contestants are given different challenges each week. RuPaul's Drag Race employs a panel of judges,
                including RuPaul, Michelle Visage, and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress
                throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on drag queen and drag racing, and the title
                sequence and song "Drag Race" both have a drag-racing theme.
